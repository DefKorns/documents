## New Computing Systems

2015 has seen several increases of the computing capacity of the UL HPC platform with the following
additions to the Gaia cluster which more than doubled its computing power:  

Two big SMP systems dedicated to the [RUES](http://wwwfr.uni.lu/research/fstc/research_unit_in_engineering_science_rues) research unit for Computational Mechanics workloads, and respectively to [LCSB](http://lcsb.uni.lu) for Bioinformatics:

* Delta D88x-M8-BI (gaia-80) featuring 8 * Intel Xeon E7-8880v2 @ 2.5 GHz (120 cores: 2.4 TFlops) with 3TB of RAM and 12.6TB of local storage;
* SGI UV 2000 (gaia-81) featuring 16 * Intel Xeon E5-4650v2 @ 2.4 GHz (160 cores: 3 TFlops) with 4TB of RAM;

The large amount of memory available on these systems enable in-memory processing of huge datasets, making possible amazing analyses and simulations.

Two ultra-dense enclosures with state-of-the-art general purpose computing systems:

* Dell FC430 (gaia-[155..178]): 24 computing nodes each with 2 * Intel Xeon E5-2680v3 @ 2.5 GHz	and 128GB of RAM (576 cores: 23.04 TFlops)

Two dense, energy efficient enclosures with low power high performance CPUs based on the Haswell architecture featuring the Crystalwell package (large 128MB L4 cache):

* HP Moonshot (moonshot1-[1..30], moonshot2-[1..45]): 75 nodes, each with an Intel Xeon E3-1284Lv3 @ 1.8 GHz and 32GB of RAM (300 cores: 8.64 TFlops and 2.4TB of RAM in total).  

The moonshot nodes are ideal for a variety of BigData analytics workloads that are loosely coupled. 

Before the end of the year further expansion of the Gaia cluster is foreseen with new GPU computing capabilities. Ultra-dense Dell C4130 GPU nodes containing 4 NVIDIA Tesla K80 accelerators with 24 GB of memory each will complement the existing pool of GPGPU capable nodes.
Many domain specific (e.g. physics: ABINIT, bioinformatics: GROMACS, engineering: Abaqus FEA) and general purpose (e.g. MATLAB) software present on the UL HPC platform can benefit from the new GPU accelerators, resulting in a shorter time-to-solution improving productivity.
