Two HPC schools have been organized in 2015 by the HPC team, comprising
tutorials and practical sessions meant to promote best practices in the
usage of the platform.
In March, 35 UL staff and students registered to the newcomer sessions meant to cover
foundation topics (UL HPC overview, access and basic usage).

In June, the yearly two-day workshop has been organized together with leading computational scientists
of the UL and HPC technologists. The workshop offered a broad set of sessions focusing on both
foundation and advanced topics:

* access to and interaction with the UL HPC infrastructures;
* HPC challenges, especially as regards data and storage management;
* HPC workflow management for sequential and parallel tasks;
* HPC programming and usage of the main software and tools available on the platform
  (Matlab, R, physics, chemistry, bioinformatics tools, MPI implementations) and 
  services (Galaxy) using the platform;
* scientific visualization;
* software environment management;
* virtualization on the clusters linked to the Grid'5000 platform.

48 UL staff and students registered to this summer school, with the participants
entitled to 1 ECTS credit offered by the 
[Doctoral School of Computer Science and Computer Engineering](http://wwwen.uni.lu/formations/fstc/doctoral_school_of_computer_science_and_computer_engineering)
upon the successful completion of the sessions.
