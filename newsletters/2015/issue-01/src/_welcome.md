As part of the UL HPC quality plan, we are proud to announce the release on a quarterly basis of a UL HPC newsletter. 
The objective is to keep you informed of the latest advances and news as regards the [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) platform.

So you hold the very first issue where we will review 2014 activities and achievements, detail the 2015 edition of the [UL HPC school](https://hpc.uni.lu/hpc-school/) that will stand on June 18th and 19th, in the Limpersberg campus.
Also we will detail the upgrade plan for all the clusters, the brand new [RESIF](https://github.com/ULHPC/resif) framework able to facilitate the management of the software built on top of the platform and available as [Environment modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/).
