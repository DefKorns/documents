As part of the UL HPC quality plan, we are proud to announce the release on a quarterly basis of a UL HPC newsletter. 
The objective is to keep you informed of the latest advances and news as regards the [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) platform.

So you hold the very first issue where we will

* review 2014 activities and achievements;
* outline the upgrade plans for all the clusters in the coming weeks and months, whether in terms of **storage** (GPFS, Isilon, GlusterFS over Certons etc.), **computing** (introducing the new [SGi](http://www.sgi.com/), [Delta](http://www.deltacomputer.com/d88x-m8-bi.html) and [HP](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/moonshot/) hardware) or **services** (such as the new [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) portal or the [RESIF](https://github.com/ULHPC/resif) framework able to facilitate the management of the software built on top of the platform and available as [Environment modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/).

Finally, the 2015 edition of the [UL HPC school](https://hpc.uni.lu/hpc-school/) will be detailed.
Would you have any comment, the \LaTeX\ sources of this newsletter are available on [Github](https://github.com/ULHPC/documents/tree/master/newsletters/2015/issue-01/src).
