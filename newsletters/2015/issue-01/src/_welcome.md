As part of the UL HPC quality plan, we are proud to announce the release on a quarterly basis of a UL HPC newsletter. 
The objective is to keep you informed of the latest advances and news as regards the [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) platform.

So you hold the very first issue where we: 

* review 2014 activities and achievements;
* outline the HPC platform upgrade plans for the coming weeks and months, whether in terms of **storage** (GPFS, Isilon, GlusterFS), **computing** (introducing new systems from [SGI](https://www.sgi.com/products/servers/uv/uv_2000_20.html), [Delta](http://www.deltacomputer.com/d88x-m8-bi.html) and [HP](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/products/servers/moonshot/)) or **services** (such as the new [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) portal or the [RESIF](https://github.com/ULHPC/resif) framework able to facilitate the management of the software built on top of the platform and available as [Environment modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/).

Finally, the 2015 editions of the [UL HPC school](https://hpc.uni.lu/hpc-school/) will be detailed.
We hope that this initial newsletter is informative and interesting for you, and we welcome your comments and questions [by mail](mailto:hpc-sysadmins@uni.lu), [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ULHPC) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ULHPC/documents/issues).
