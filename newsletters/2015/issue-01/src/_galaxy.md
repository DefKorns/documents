[Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org) is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. It allows users to easily perform, reproduce and share complete bioinformatics analyses.

The Galaxy service has been integrated with the Gaia cluster, enabling many users to work in parallel and use the computing power of this cluster.

UL users have access to Galaxy at [galaxy-server.uni.lu](http://galaxy-server.uni.lu) with their HPC credentials.
