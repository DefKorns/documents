# Release of RESIF: New tool to ease the management of software modules on the platform and your machine

RESIF is an internally developped tool that aims at making management of software on the UL HPC platform more accessible. The main features of RESIF are the automitization of the creation of a new software stack and of the addition of software to an existing software stack.

The workflow becomes simple and using this tool doesn't require the user to have any knowledge of how things work in the background anymore. This following schema summarizes this workflow:

As you can see, after a short installation step, RESIF allows the creation of a new software stack and the addition of software to it in a few readable commands. The swsets.yaml file alone describes the software you want to have and make it easier to replicate an installation if you want to reproduce the same environmenet than before.

Along with the RESIF release, a new naming scheme for the software modules is making its debut to improve the organisation of the software, give more information about them and make better use of the search features of the platform.
