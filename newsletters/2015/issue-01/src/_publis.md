In an attempt to promote the management operated on the [UL HPC platform](http://hpc.uni.lu), an article has been published in the [IEEE HPCS'2014](http://hpcs2014.cisedu.info/) \cite{VBCG_HPCS14} -- see [the corresponding ORBilu entry](http://hdl.handle.net/10993/16622).

It is also the occasion to recall that you are asked through the [AUP](https://hpc.uni.lu/users/AUP.html) to **acknowledge** your usage of the UL HPC platform in your research articles, and to cite the above mentioned paper if it is  possible.

**More importantly**, you should mark your own [ORBilu](http://orbilu.uni.lu/) entries with the `ULHPC` tag using the guidelines proposed on the [UL HPC website](https://hpc.uni.lu/about/publis.html#acknowledgement-banner-and-orbilu-instructions).
