# New computing equipment

New specialized computing systems will be part of the UL HPC platform in early 2015:

* Delta D88x-M8-BI (Gaia cluster: gaia-80) featuring 8 * Intel Xeon E7-8880v2 @ 2.5 GHz (120 cores: 2.4 TFlops) with 3TB of RAM and 12.6TB of local storage;
* SGI UV 2000 (Gaia cluster: gaia-81) featuring 16 * Intel Xeon E5-4650v2 @ 2.4 GHz (160 cores: 3 TFlops) with 4TB of RAM;
* HP Moonshot (Nyx cluster: moonshot-1): 30 blades each with an Intel Xeon E3-1284Lv3 @ 1.8 GHz and 32GB of RAM (120 cores: 3.4 TFlops and 960GB of RAM in total).

The Delta system will be used by RUES members for Computational Mechanics workloads, 
while the SGI UV-2000 system will be dedicated for bioinformatics analyses of the LCSB.

The HP Moonshot mini-cluster will be initially used by the HPC team as a testbed for new software solutions
and for the evaluation of this low-power platform for HPC workloads.
