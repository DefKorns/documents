In May 2014 the HPC Team successfully held the [first edition of the UL HPC School](https://hpc.uni.lu/hpc-school/2014/index.html) which covered both basic and advanced usage of the HPC platform.

More than 60 participants from the FSTC, LCSB, SnT, FDEF and FLSHASE took part in the 8 practical sessions which spanned two days.
For 2015, we are happy to announce the follow-up of this event.

For a better dissemination of the best practices among all UL users (including newcomers), the HPC Schools will be reproduced in two versions:

* training for newcomers, focusing on the basics, provided in half-day practical sessions twice a year (typically in March and October), to cover the arrival of new hires;
* the regular HPC School (a 2 days event covering all aspects including advanced ones) will be held once a year in June.

The first [Newcomer Training Day](http://hpc.uni.lu/hpc-school/) took place on _March 13th, 2015_ in the Kirchberg campus -- see [the official webpage](https://hpc.uni.lu/hpc-school/2015/03/) for details. 

The second edition of the regular HPC School will take place on **June, 18th-19th**, and will feature new and updated sessions compared with the previous event, based on its feedback.
The full programme of this event will be announced in May.
