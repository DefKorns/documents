In the information and computational science age, most university research units and centers need to perform complex computations and process very large amounts of data.
The [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) facility encompasses a High Performance Computing environment and high density Data storage. The bridge between computing and storage is a specificity of the UL service, with reasons both legal (certain data must not move out of the country) and performance related.

Currently the provided HPC services are used by people from the 3 Faculties and the 2 Interdisciplinary Centers (ICs). Key research priorities of the [UL](http://www.uni.lu), such as computational sciences, systems biomedicine and security, reliability & trust require access to HPC facilities in order to function and advance.

In this issue, we would like to review the main achievements made since the beginning of the year 2015.
In particular, we will cover:

* the new collaborating services deployed: [GitLab](https://gitlab.uni.lu) and  [Owncloud](https://owncloud.uni.lu);
* the two HPC workshops organized this year, with both advanced and introductory sessions for new UL scientific personnel and students;
* the largest software upgrades performed in the 8 years existence of the UL HPC platform, thanks to the [RESIF](http://resif.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) framework.
* the computational power increase (__+42,67 TFlops__) of the [Gaia](https://hpc.uni.lu/systems/gaia/) cluster with state of the art hardware;
* the data storage capacity increase by __1.85__ PB;
