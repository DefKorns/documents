The [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) platform has continuously evolved since the initial computing servers ordered in 2006.
The HPC equipment is based on both classical Commercial off-the shelf (COTS) and specialized products.
\begin{tcolorbox}
  The \ulhpc features as of January 2016, a computational power of \underline{\textbf{87 TFlops}}
  (5316 computing cores) and \underline{\textbf{5.1 PBytes}} for storage (incl. 1.7 PB for backups).
\end{tcolorbox}

As of January 2016, **335 users** are registered and active on the platform.
The used computing time in 2015 by the registered users is measured at **__2259__ CPUYears**, thus __performed in a single year__ period. This confirms the increasing usage of the platform over the years (see below) and demonstrates our commitment to excellence and continuous improvement to accelerate scientific discovery and innovation within the University (see also the [list of publications generated thanks to the UL HPC Platform](http://orbilu.uni.lu/simple-search?query=%28%28researchcenter%3AULHPC%29%29&title=Publications+generated+thanks+to+the+UL+HPC+Platform&sort_by0=1&order0=DESC&sort_by1=3&order1=ASC&sort_by2=2&order2=ASC).)

\noindent
In terms of cumulative hardware investments since 2007 (excluding server rooms costs), we now reach a total of __5.244 Mâ‚¬__. This continuous effort makes the [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) platform __the largest facility of this type in Luxembourg__ (after GoodYear R&D Center) and is competitive with similar centers in the Grande-Region (see below)

In 2016, a new supercomputing site will be opened at the Belval campus, in the House of Knowledge's Computing Center (Maison du Savoir - Centre de Calcul, shown below). The new site will host the HPC equipment designed to support and advance the next generation science at the UL.
