## IPCEI-HPC-BDA

You might have noticed a recent change in the global perception of HPC around you.
Too often neglected in the past, EU acknowledged recently the "_necessity to act and invest in the development and deployment of HPC technology, Big Data and Applications_" (see [Blog post of EU Commissioner on Digital Economy & Society G. H. Oettinger](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/oettinger/blog/luxembourg-launches-supercomputing-project_en)).

> _Failure to do so will seriously undermine European competitiveness and Europe will miss an important opportunity to ensure its industries compete on a global level_

As a consequence, A European Strategic Positioning Paper was released to define an _Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI)_ on HPC and Big Data Enabled Applications [__IPCEI-HPC-BDA__](http://knowledgebase.e-irg.eu/documents/243153/299805/IPCEI-HPC-BDA.pdf) by the Luxembourg government. 
The project was officially launched on November 17th 2015 at the [European Data Forum](http://2015.data-forum.eu/) together with France, Italy and Spain -- an [article](http://www.wort.lu/de/business/le-luxembourg-aux-manettes-un-superordinateur-a-six-milliards-d-euros-56a5d8890da165c55dc51d19) was published in Wort at this occasion.

In this context, the [UL](http://www.uni.lu), together with the [LIST](http://list.lu) and [Luxinnovation](http://www.luxinnovation.lu/) will support the Ministry of Economy to provide an HPC and Big Data Enabled Applications implementation roadmap to the European Council and European Commission by September 2016.
