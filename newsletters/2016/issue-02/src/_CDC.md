By end 2016, a new supercomputing site will be implemented at the Belval campus, in the House of Knowledge's Computing Center (_Maison du Savoir - Centre de Calcul_, shown left).
Located underground (CDC S-02) below the floor already deployed to host Restena, SIU and research equipment, the new site will feature up to 5 server rooms dedicated to the hosting of the future UL HPC platform (2 for pure HPC equipment, 2 for storage and 1 hybrid).
In line with the continuous efforts to build a green and sustainable campus, the future UL HPC site will feature cutting-edge cooling technologies based on Direct Liquid Cooling ([DLC](http://www.hpcwire.com/2015/06/29/direct-contact-liquid-cooling-continues-its-move-into-the-data-center/)).
Designed in a step-wise approach, the implementation of the new UL HPC platform will permit to reach a capacity of __3 PFlops__ (for computing) and __20 PB__ (for storage) by 2020, thus supporting and advance the next generation science at the UL and abroad.
