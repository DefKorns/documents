## HPC as part of the UL Digital Strategy

Since his arrival at the head of the University, our new president [Rainer Klump](http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/interview-with-rainer-klump-moving-the-university-of-luxembourg-forward-55192b3a0c88b46a8ce5675d) aimed at defining an ambitious Digital Strategy for the university that would make it a model European Research University of the 21st century.
In this context, the president confirms the UL HPC is a key supporting infrastructure for this strategy and took the following decisions:

* Prof. Pascal Bouvry has been officially appointed Senior advisor (_Charg√© de mission_) to the rectorate for the HPC strategy.
* The UL HPC budget has been significantly increased to match the proposed strategy (approved by the rectorate in April 2015)
* The responsibility for this budget has been transferred to Prof. Pascal Bouvry.

The coming months will bring additional changes, for instance in the governance of the HPC department. We will keep you informed on any updates on this topic.
