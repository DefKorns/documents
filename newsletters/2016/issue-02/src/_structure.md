## HPC as part of the UL Digital Strategy

Since his arrival at the head of the University, our new president [Rainer Klump](http://www.wort.lu/en/luxembourg/interview-with-rainer-klump-moving-the-university-of-luxembourg-forward-55192b3a0c88b46a8ce5675d) aimed at defining an ambitious Digital Strategy for the university that would make it a model European Research University of the 21st century.
In this context, the president confirms the [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) as a key supporting infrastructure for this strategy. To this end: 

* Prof. Pascal Bouvry has been officially appointed Senior advisor for the president (_Chargé de mission auprès du recteur_) as regards the HPC strategy;
* The UL HPC budget has been significantly increased to match the proposed strategy (approved by the rectorate in April 2015). The responsibility for this budget has been transferred from Prof. Franck Leprévost to Prof. Pascal Bouvry.

This definitively rewards our continuous efforts, and especially the ones of the former vice-president Prof. Franck Leprévost, to give to HPC the necessary recognition and means (_i.e_ budget) at the highest levels. We are thus very thankful for his restless support, vision and steering over the last years (that permitted to bring the effort of the University to develop the HPC facility from 250 K€ to 2 M€ per year) and wish him the best  in the next challenges of his career.

The coming months will bring additional changes, especially as regards the HPC governance. All changes in the management structure will be communicated immediately.
