The HPC equipment is based on both classical Commercial off-the shelf (COTS) and specialized products. 

The UL HPC features as of Nov. 2015, **68.72 TFlops** for computations (over 4788 cores) and **4.54 PetaBytes** for storage. Today the HPC equipment is distributed in 4 different server rooms, two in Kirchberg and two in Belval.

In details, the facility is composed of 3 main clusters, namely `chaos`, `gaia` and `g5k`, the later being part of the [Grid5000](http://grid5000.fr) project, a scientific instrument distributed in 10 sites (mainly in France) for research in large-scale parallel and distributed systems. A fourth cluster named `nyx` is available for experimental purposes and research on cutting-edge hardware components. From a general perspective, the clusters of the UL HPC facility have the following computing characteristics:

The [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) platform has continuously evolved since the initial computing servers ordered in 2006.
The HPC equipment is based on both classical Commercial off-the shelf (COTS) and specialized products.
\begin{tcolorbox}
  The \ulhpc features as of January 2016, a computational power of \textbf{87 TFlops}
  (5316 computing cores) and \textbf{5.1 PBytes} for storage (incl. 1.7 PB for backups).

<!-- 2015 OAR accounting Gaia+Chaos: 47107252602 + 24161982905 = 71269235507s = 2259.93y --->
As of January 2016, **335 users** are registered and active on the platform.
The used computing time in 2015 by the registered users is measured at **__2259__ CPUYears**, thus performed in a single year period.


In 2016, a new supercomputing site will be opened at the Belval campus, in the House of Knowledge's Computing Center (Maison du Savoir - Centre de Calcul, shown below). The new site will host the HPC equipment designed to support and advance the next generation science at the UL.
