## UL HPC Statistics

The [UL HPC](http://hpc.uni.lu) platform has continuously evolved since the initial computing servers ordered in 2006.
The HPC equipment is based on both classical Commercial off-the shelf (COTS) and specialized products.
\begin{tcolorbox}
  The \ulhpc features as of January 2016, a computational power of \textbf{87 TFlops}
  (over 5316 computing cores) and \textbf{5.1 PBytes} for storage (incl.
  1.7 PB for backups).
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent
The evolution of both computing and storage capacity, is depicted in the below figures.

\end{figure}

As of January 2016, **321 users** are registered and active on the platform.
The used computing effort so far in 2015 by the registered users is measured at **__???__ CPUYears**, thus performed in a single year period.
