In the second half of 2015, we have opened access to a new online collaboration
service: [GitLab.uni.lu](https://gitlab.uni.lu) (right). Its primary function is __advanced Git repository management__,
and among its features we can highlight per-project issue tracking, wiki and easy to use continuous integration
([CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/)). The GitLab service is immediately available to UL HPC platform
users with their account and to their external collaborators that have a [GitHub](http://github.com) account.

Our long-running [GForge.uni.lu](https://gforge.uni.lu) <!-- web-based project-management and --> collaboration system (left)
has recently been upgraded.
<!-- As GitLab, it also provides Git project hosting, issue and task tracking but allows
also the creation of SVN repositories, discussion forums and mailing lists. Web-based source code browsing
for peer review is possible for both Git and SVN, although the functionality for Git is less advanced than
the one available on GitLab.
-->
Its project __web site hosting__ feature, along with the support of __Git and Subversion__,  <!--, along with the messaging capabilities -->
make the GForge a very useful service. Access to GForge is through dedicated accounts, available on request
to the administrative email address [`admin@gforge.uni.lu`](mailto:admin@gforge.uni.lu), for both UL members and external partners.

\noindent
For easy, __Dropbox-like__, file sharing (and since we were not convinced by the official DropIT system)we have deployed an [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.uni.lu) instance (right), which provides online access to data through a clean web interface, user file encryption and group content sharing among a multitude of other features. 
<!-- From its many capabilities we note: the possibility to connect to external storage (including Dropbox, Google
Drive, Amazon S3 and others), encrypt user files, group content sharing, integrated real-time collaborative
document editor, file viewer (for OpenDocument formats, PDF, photos and videos), address book, calendar and
task scheduler.  -->
OwnCloud is available on UL premises (or through the [VPN](https://vulcain.uni.lu)) for UL HPC users.
<!-- We will enable [federated cloud sharing](https://owncloud.org/federation/),
linking it to the future LCSB dedicated instances. -->

The [Galaxy](http://galaxy-server.uni.lu) portal was also updated (left). This web-based platform provides a simplified interface to many popular __bioinformatics tools and generation of reproducible workflows__. Many more tools are now available, especially for the analysis of ChIP and RNA sequencing and variant data. <!--For a quick start we provide example workflows for these analyses.-->
