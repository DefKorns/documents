In the second half of 2015, we have opened access to a new online collaboration
service: [GitLab.uni.lu](https://gitlab.uni.lu). Its primary function is advanced Git repository management,
and among its features we can highlight per-project issue tracking, wiki and easy to use continuous integration
([CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/)). The GitLab service is immediately available to UL HPC platform
users with their account and to their external collaborators that have a GitHub account.

Our long-running [GForge.uni.lu](https://gforge.uni.lu) web-based project-management and collaboration system
has recently been upgraded. As GitLab, it also provides Git project hosting, issue and task tracking but allows
also the creation of SVN repositories, discussion forums and mailing lists. Web-based source code browsing
for peer review is possible for both Git and SVN, although the functionality for Git is less advanced than
the one available on GitLab. Its project web site hosting feature, along with the messaging capabilities
make the GForge a very useful service. Access to GForge is through dedicated accounts, available on request
to the administrative [email address](mailto:admin@gforge.uni.lu), for both UL members and external partners.

For easy, Dropbox-like, file sharing we will soon release an [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.uni.lu) instance,
which provides online access to data through a clean web interface and cross-platform sync clients.
From its many capabilities we note: the possibility to connect to external storage (including Dropbox, Google
Drive, Amazon S3 and others), encrypt user files, group content sharing, integrated real-time collaborative
document editor, file viewer (for OpenDocument formats, PDF, photos and videos), address book, calendar and
task scheduler. OwnCloud is currently available for testing on UL premises (or through the VPN) for UL users
with HPC accounts. Once deployed, we will enable [federated cloud sharing](https://owncloud.org/federation/),
linking it to the future LCSB dedicated instances.

We updated the [Galaxy](http://galaxy-server.uni.lu) portal, a web-based platform that provides a simplified interface to many popular bioinformatics tools and allows to generate reproducible workflows. Many more tools are now available, especially for the analysis of ChIP sequencing, RNA sequencing and variant data. For an easy start we also provide some exemplary workflows for these analyses.
