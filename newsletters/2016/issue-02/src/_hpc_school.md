Two [HPC schools](https://hpc.uni.lu/hpc-school) have been organized in 2015 by the [HPC team](https://hpc.uni.lu/about/team.html), comprising
tutorials and practical sessions meant to promote best practices in the
usage of the platform.

\noindent 
In __March__, 35 UL staff and students registered to the newcomer sessions meant to cover
foundation topics (UL HPC overview, access and basic usage).
In __June__, the yearly two-day workshop has been organized together with leading computational scientists
of the UL and HPC technologists. The workshop offered a broad set of sessions focusing on both
foundation and advanced topics:

* access to and interaction with the UL HPC infrastructures;
* HPC challenges, especially as regards data and storage management;
* HPC workflow management for sequential and parallel tasks;
* HPC programming and usage of the main [software and tools](http://hpc.uni.lu/users/software) available on the platform
  (Matlab, R, physics, chemistry, bioinformatics tools, MPI implementations) and
  services (Galaxy) using the platform;
* scientific visualization and software environment management.

\noindent
48 UL staff and students registered to this summer school, with the participants
entitled to 1 ECTS credit offered by the
[Doctoral School of Computer Science and Computer Engineering](http://wwwen.uni.lu/formations/fstc/doctoral_school_of_computer_science_and_computer_engineering)
upon the successful completion of the sessions.
