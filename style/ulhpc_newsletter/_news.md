# \faBullhorn\ What's new?

New features: services/improvements we've introduced, new software
available, etc.

Notice the use of \LaTeX\ code within [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text. 
You have thus access to the nice syntax of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to simplify your writing:

* that's an item
* another item
     - a sub-item with a `verbatim` text
* item

```
some code extract
```
